Teaching an agent play Tic-Tac-Toe through Reinforcement Learning (RL). RL involves training an agent to make optimal decisions by learning from interactions with its environment to maximize cumulative rewards. Specifically, the Q-Learning algorithm is used to learn the value of action-state pairs (Q-values), guiding the agent toward optimal play. To balance exploration and exploitation, an epsilon-greedy strategy is employed, where the agent occasionally makes random moves (exploration) with a probability 系系 and otherwise selects actions based on learned Q-values (exploitation). This probability 系系 decays over time, allowing the agent to rely more on its acquired knowledge while still exploring new strategies to avoid suboptimal policies.
